# 🕹️ Cub3D: Raycasting Game Engine

Cub3D is a 42 school project inspired by *Wolfenstein 3D*.  
It implements a simple 3D game engine using raycasting, rendering a maze in first-person view with walls, floor, and ceiling textures.  
The project improves skills in **C programming, graphics, math, and algorithms**, while using the **MiniLibX** library.
